# SatsSpend - Australian Bitcoin Business List (Website)

This is a website version of the SatsSpend list (located here: https://github.com/Daunus/SatsSpend).

The website includes a searchable/interactive map and database of Australian bitcoin businesses.

Until the site is migrated to its own domain and hosting, it can be accessed here: https://mission-bitcoin.github.io/satsspend-australian_bitcoin_business_list/

**To do**
- add Australia-wide/online-only businesses to table list and maybe the map (unsure where to position markers for each?)
- redo colour scheme (darker background?)
