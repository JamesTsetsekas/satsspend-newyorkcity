# SatsSpend - Australian Bitcoin Business List (Website)

SatsSpend is a website of Australian businesses that accept bitcoin, including a searchable map and list. There are also some useful resources for spenders and receivers of bitcoin towards the bottom of the page.

Until the site is migrated to its own domain and hosting, it can be accessed here: https://mission-bitcoin.github.io/satsspend-australian_bitcoin_business_list/
